        <p> Hi! I'm Federico, I love everything related to data and their use in real problem. From classical statistical analysis to more technology-based approaches like using AI, always with a statistical and mathematical approach in mind. I'm fast and experienced with computers and modern technologies. I have a good base of coding skills, particularly in Python and R, but I'm always open to learning new tools. 😁 <br>
