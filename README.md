# Personal Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences. It is built using Svelte, SvelteKit, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
**Svelte**: The project is developed using the Svelte framework, which offers a delightful development experience with its reactive and component-based approach.

**SvelteKit**: SvelteKit is used as the framework for building the portfolio. It provides a powerful routing system, server-side rendering, and various other features to create fast and dynamic web applications.

**Tailwind CSS**: The portfolio's styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It allows for rapid UI development with pre-defined classes and customizable design options.

> .svelte-kit and node_modules folders are note uploaded here, standard from the sveltekit installation script.
